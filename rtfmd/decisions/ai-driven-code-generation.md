## Decision Context

The OpenSCAD MCP Server requires a mechanism to translate natural language descriptions into valid OpenSCAD code. This architectural decision record documents the approach chosen for implementing AI-driven code generation.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Template-Based Approach

A simple approach using predefined templates with parameter substitution.

**Pros:**
- Simple implementation
- Predictable output
- Low computational requirements

**Cons:**
- Limited flexibility
- Cannot handle complex or novel descriptions
- Requires manual creation of templates for each shape type

### Option 2: Full Machine Learning Approach

Using embeddings and neural networks to generate OpenSCAD code directly.

**Pros:**
- Highly flexible
- Can handle novel descriptions
- Potential for more natural interaction

**Cons:**
- High computational requirements
- Requires training data
- Less predictable output
- Harder to debug and maintain

### Option 3: Hybrid Pattern Matching with Contextual Rules

Combining pattern matching for parameter extraction with rule-based code generation.

**Pros:**
- Good balance of flexibility and predictability
- Moderate computational requirements
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Can be extended with more sophisticated ML in the future

**Cons:**
- More complex than pure template approach
- Less flexible than full ML approach
- Requires careful design of rules and patterns

## Decision

**Chosen Option: Option 3 - Hybrid Pattern Matching with Contextual Rules**

The hybrid approach was selected because it provides a good balance of flexibility, maintainability, and computational efficiency. It allows for handling a wide range of natural language descriptions while maintaining predictable output and being easier to debug than a full ML approach.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of two main components:

1. **Parameter Extractor**: Uses regex patterns and contextual rules to extract parameters from natural language descriptions.

2. **Code Generator**: Translates extracted parameters into OpenSCAD code using a combination of templates and programmatic generation.

The `AIService` class provides the bridge between these components, handling the overall flow from natural language to code.

```python
class AIService:
    def __init__(self, templates_dir, model_config=None):
        self.templates_dir = templates_dir
        self.model_config = model_config or {}
        self.templates = self._load_templates()
    
    def generate_openscad_code(self, context):
        description = context.get("description", "")
        parameters = context.get("parameters", {})
        
        # Parse the description to identify key components
        components = self._parse_description(description)
        
        # Generate code based on identified components
        code = self._generate_code_from_components(components, parameters)
        
        return code
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- More flexible code generation than a pure template approach
- Better maintainability than a full ML approach
- Lower computational requirements
- Easier to debug and extend
- Can handle a wide range of natural language descriptions

### Negative

- More complex implementation than a pure template approach
- Requires careful design of patterns and rules
- May still struggle with very complex or ambiguous descriptions

### Neutral

- Will require ongoing maintenance as new shape types and features are added
- May need to be extended with more sophisticated ML techniques in the future

## Follow-up Actions

- Implement unit tests for the AI service
- Create a comprehensive set of test cases for different description types
- Document the pattern matching rules and code generation logic
- Consider adding a feedback mechanism to improve the system over time
