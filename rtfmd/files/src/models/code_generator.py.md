  prompt: "Implement AI-driven code generator for OpenSCAD"
</metadata>

<exploration>
  The code generator was designed to translate natural language descriptions and extracted parameters into valid OpenSCAD code. Several approaches were considered:
  
  1. Direct string manipulation for code generation
  2. Template-based approach with parameter substitution
  3. Modular approach with separate modules for different shape types
  
  The modular approach was selected for its maintainability and extensibility.
</exploration>

<mental-model>
  The code generator operates on a "shape-to-module" mapping paradigm, where each identified shape type corresponds to a specific OpenSCAD module. This mental model allows for clean separation of concerns and makes it easy to add new shape types.
</mental-model>

<pattern-recognition>
  The implementation uses the Factory pattern for code generation, where different shape types are mapped to different module generators. This pattern allows for easy extension with new shape types.
</pattern-recognition>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  1. Generating raw OpenSCAD primitives directly
  2. Using a library of pre-defined modules
  3. Hybrid approach with both primitives and modules
  
  The library approach was chosen because:
  - More maintainable and readable code
  - Easier to implement complex shapes
  - Better parameter handling
  - More consistent output
</trade-off>

<domain-knowledge>
  The implementation required understanding of:
  - OpenSCAD syntax and semantics
  - Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) operations
  - Parametric modeling concepts
  - 3D geometry fundamentals
</domain-knowledge>

<technical-debt>
  The current implementation has some limitations:
  - Limited support for complex nested operations
  - No support for custom user-defined modules
  - Basic error handling for invalid parameters
  
  Future improvements planned:
  - Enhanced error handling with meaningful messages
  - Support for user-defined modules
  - More sophisticated CSG operation chaining
</technical-debt>
