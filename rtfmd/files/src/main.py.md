  prompt: "Build an MCP server for OpenSCAD"
</metadata>

<exploration>
  The main application was designed to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenSCAD integration. Several approaches were considered:
  
  1. Using a standalone server with direct OpenSCAD CLI calls
  2. Implementing a web service with REST API
  3. Creating an MCP-compliant server with FastAPI
  
  The MCP-compliant FastAPI approach was selected for its alignment with the project requirements and modern API design.
</exploration>

<mental-model>
  The main application operates on a "tool-based MCP service" paradigm, where each capability is exposed as an MCP tool that can be called by AI assistants. This mental model aligns with the MCP specification and provides a clean separation of concerns.
</mental-model>

<pattern-recognition>
  The implementation uses the Facade pattern to provide a simple interface to the complex subsystems (parameter extraction, code generation, OpenSCAD wrapper, etc.). This pattern simplifies the client interface and decouples the subsystems from clients.
</pattern-recognition>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  1. Monolithic application with tightly coupled components
  2. Microservices architecture with separate services
  3. Modular monolith with clear component boundaries
  
  The modular monolith approach was chosen because:
  - Simpler deployment and operation
  - Lower latency for inter-component communication
  - Easier to develop and debug
  - Still maintains good separation of concerns
</trade-off>

<domain-knowledge>
  The implementation required understanding of:
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification
  - FastAPI framework
  - OpenSCAD command-line interface
  - 3D modeling and printing workflows
</domain-knowledge>

<technical-debt>
  The current implementation has some limitations:
  - In-memory storage of models (not persistent)
  - Basic error handling
  - Limited printer discovery capabilities
  
  Future improvements planned:
  - Persistent storage for models
  - Enhanced error handling and reporting
  - More robust printer discovery and management
</technical-debt>
