  prompt: "Enhance parameter extractor with expanded shape recognition"
</metadata>

<exploration>
  The parameter extractor was designed to parse natural language descriptions and extract structured parameters for 3D model generation. Several approaches were considered:
  
  1. Using a full NLP pipeline with named entity recognition
  2. Implementing regex-based pattern matching
  3. Creating a hybrid approach with contextual understanding
  
  The regex-based approach with contextual enhancements was selected for its balance of simplicity and effectiveness.
</exploration>

<mental-model>
  The parameter extractor operates on a "pattern recognition and extraction" paradigm, where common phrases and patterns in natural language are mapped to specific parameter types. This mental model allows for intuitive parameter extraction from diverse descriptions.
</mental-model>

<pattern-recognition>
  The implementation uses the Strategy pattern for different parameter extraction strategies based on shape type. This pattern allows for specialized extraction logic for each shape type while maintaining a consistent interface.
</pattern-recognition>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  1. Machine learning-based approach with trained models
  2. Pure regex pattern matching
  3. Hybrid approach with contextual rules
  
  The regex approach with contextual rules was chosen because:
  - Simpler implementation with good accuracy
  - No training data required
  - Easier to debug and maintain
  - More predictable behavior
</trade-off>

<domain-knowledge>
  The implementation required understanding of:
  - Natural language processing concepts
  - Regular expression pattern matching
  - 3D modeling terminology
  - Parameter types for different geometric shapes
</domain-knowledge>

<technical-debt>
  The current implementation has some limitations:
  - Limited support for complex nested descriptions
  - Regex patterns may need maintenance as language evolves
  - Only supports millimeters as per project requirements
  
  Future improvements planned:
  - Enhanced contextual understanding
  - Support for more complex descriptions
  - Better handling of ambiguous parameters
</technical-debt>
